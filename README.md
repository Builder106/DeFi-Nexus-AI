# OmniAgent Hub

OmniAgent Hub is a decentralized multi-agent platform built on NEAR Protocol that empowers developers to create and deploy autonomous agents across multiple domains including DeFi, social media, absurd experiments, and more.

## Overview

Built on NEAR Testnet/Mainnet, the system consists of:

- **Smart Contracts:** Written in Rust using near-sdk for secure on-chain logic.
- **Frontend:** A React (TypeScript) based web application.
- **Modular Agent Architecture:** Modules include DeFi Agents, Social Media Agents, Absurd Agents, Aurora Chain Integration, HOT Wallet integration, Bitte Chain Abstraction, Bitcoin Agents, cross-chain trading and liquidity management.

## Modules and Features

- **DeFi Agents:** Market making, yield optimization, portfolio management, AI trading, and DCA strategies.
- **Social Media Agents:** Twitter/X bot interfaces and meme agents for decentralized interactions.
- **Absurd Agents:** Creative and experimental agents for outlandish interactions.
- **Aurora Integration:** Dedicated governance chain deployment via Aurora Cloud Console.
- **HOT Wallet Module:** Integration with the HOT Omni SDK for cross-network token transfers.
- **Bitte Integration:** Chain abstraction-based agents compatible with both EVM and NEAR apps.
- **Bitcoin Agents:** Utilize NEAR chain signatures to manage Bitcoin transactions.
- **Cross-chain Trading & Liquidity Management:** Agents for autonomous management using NEAR intents and VeaxFlow API.

## Development Roadmap

1. **Core Architecture & API:** Establish smart contracts and a web frontend.
2. **Module Development:** Build and integrate each specialized agent module.
3. **Third-Party Integrations:** Integrate Aurora, HOT SDK, Bitte, Twitter API and more.
4. **Testing & Deployment:** Deploy on NEAR Testnet/Mainnet, demo preparation, and full documentation.

## Getting Started

- Clone the repository.
- Follow the instructions in the `contracts/` and `frontend/` directories to build and deploy the smart contracts and web app.
- Test using NEAR CLI and run the frontend locally for a demo.
